## What is this

Moke is a native SSH / mosh terminal for Android. It connects to remote servers directly inside the app — run a shell, tmux, vim, or a full-screen TUI such as Claude Code — and reuses termux's `terminal-view` / `terminal-emulator` (Apache-2.0) for terminal rendering instead of writing its own ANSI parser.

## Features

- **SSH**: password / private-key (PEM) auth; TOFU host-key verification with fingerprint confirmation on first connection; jump host (ProxyJump); per-host startup command (e.g. pick cmd, PowerShell or WSL on a Windows host); run-on-login command; keep-alive heartbeat.
- **mosh**: bundled native `mosh-client` running as a separate subprocess over a PTY; UDP roaming (survives screen-off and network switches); closing a session also shuts down the remote `mosh-server`.
- **tmux**: a panel to attach / create / rename / detach / kill remote sessions; optionally attach automatically on connect. After the app process ends, selecting a saved tmux host attaches again by its remembered session name (not the old terminal scrollback). A saved remote project directory has a separate, explicit workspace entry; the workspace name includes a path-derived suffix to avoid confusing same-named directories.
- **Files**: browse remote folders over SFTP (SSH and mosh hosts); upload / download with resume; transfers keep running in the background. Files opened from a host with a saved project directory start there. When entered from a terminal, a completed upload adds its shell-quoted remote path to that session’s editable text-block draft; it never sends or presses Enter automatically. Overwriting an existing remote file still requires confirmation. Existing remote file paths can be sent to the terminal manually.
- **Sessions & hosts**: multiple sessions stay resident, with a foreground service keeping connections alive in the background; group / sort (including manual drag-to-reorder); duplicate; per-session titles; clear ended sessions; copy connect command. Settings → Import / export hosts creates a versioned, non-secret JSON file; import previews every host and requires an Add / Replace / Skip decision per entry. Passwords, private keys, and passphrases are not exported and must be re-entered on the new device.
- **Terminal**: two-row extra keys plus an expandable full keyboard (editing keys, F1–F12, Ctrl shortcuts) with lockable modifiers; text-block input; three keyboard modes (character / standard / IME first) for comfortable CJK input; copy & paste, including remote clipboard writes (OSC 52); pinch-to-zoom; swipe-to-scroll in full-screen TUIs with a selectable mode, plus jump-to-latest; a top status bar (protocol / host / latency).
- **Appearance**: live preview; light / dark / follow-system theme with separate terminal color schemes for each; font size / line spacing / letter spacing; cursor style; font management (primary + CJK fallback — a bundled Noto Sans SC subset, plus downloadable Fira Code / Maple Mono / Hack and more, or import your own).
- **Security, languages & updates**: credentials are encrypted with the Android Keystore (AES-GCM) before being stored and are excluded from system backups; bilingual English / 中文, following the system language by default and switchable in Settings; in-app update check (optionally including pre-releases).

## Install

From [Releases](https://github.com/ddwwbb/moke/releases), pick one:

- `moke-vX.Y.Z.apk` — standard build; CJK fallback is a bundled Noto Sans SC subset (smaller).
- `moke-vX.Y.Z-maple.apk` — bundles Maple Mono as the default CJK fallback, monospaced CJK out of the box (larger).

Allow "install from unknown sources" and install. Release builds use a stable signature, so upgrades install over the top.

## Modules

| Module | Description | License |
|---|---|---|
| `app` | Product layer (Compose UI / session orchestration / transport implementations) | GPL-3.0-or-later |
| `terminal-emulator` | Terminal parsing / state core (vendored; `TerminalSession` made transport-agnostic; the PTY JNI is kept for the mosh subprocess) | Apache-2.0 |
| `terminal-view` | Terminal rendering View (vendored; additive changes for line / letter spacing and swipe scrolling) | Apache-2.0 |

## Build

Requires JDK 17 + Android SDK (compileSdk 35 / build-tools 35). Create `local.properties` at the project root pointing to the SDK: `sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk`.

```bash
./gradlew assembleStandardDebug   # standard debug APK
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest       # unit tests

# The `maple` flavor bundles Maple Mono as the default CJK fallback.
# Fetch the font first (OFL, ~20 MB, not checked in), then build:
./scripts/fetch-maple-font.sh && ./gradlew assembleMapleDebug
```

The mosh native artifacts are reproducibly built by [`scripts/build-mosh-native.sh`](scripts/build-mosh-native.sh) from public sources (mosh 1.4.0 + rjyo/mosh-android prebuilt libs); NDK r29 is required, and the GPLv3 binaries are not checked in. The `maple` flavor's bundled font is fetched by [`scripts/fetch-maple-font.sh`](scripts/fetch-maple-font.sh) (OFL, not checked in).

## Acknowledgements & third-party

The terminal core reuses `terminal-emulator` / `terminal-view` from [termux/termux-app](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) (Apache-2.0, originally from [Android Terminal Emulator](https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator)). SSH transport uses [sshj](https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj). The mosh native component is based on [mobile-shell/mosh](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh) (GPLv3) and [rjyo/mosh-android](https://github.com/rjyo/mosh-android). The bundled Chinese font is a subset of [Noto Sans SC](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk) (OFL). See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for the full list.

The moke product layer (`app/`) is released under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 or later**; see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [COPYRIGHT.md](COPYRIGHT.md). The vendored `terminal-*` modules are Apache-2.0 (GPLv3-compatible); the mosh native component is GPLv3 and ships as a standalone executable.
